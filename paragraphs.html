    <p>This chapter presents the background of the study, statement of the problem, purpose, objectives, and research questions, scope of the study, significance and definition of key terms.</p>
    <p>According to Perez (2018), Packaging is not a recent phenomenon. Packaging is an activity closely associated with the evolution of society and can be traced back to human beginnings. The nature, degree, and amount of packaging at any stage of a society’s growth reflects the needs, cultural patterns, material availability and technology of that society. It is not known what the first package was but it is speculated that primitive humans (nomadic hunters/ gatherers) who lived off the land had social groupings restricted to family units. They would have been subject to the geographical migrations of animals and the seasonal availability of plant food. Such an extreme nomadic existence does not encourage property accumulation beyond what can be carried on one’s back or head.</p>
    <p>Primitive people needed containment and carrying devices, and out of this need came the first package – a wrap of leaves, an animal skin, the shell of a nut or gourd, a naturally hollow piece of wood, the fire-bearer and the packaging of fire.</p>  
    <p>According to Balasubramanian (2019), The industrial revolution is a concept of change that transforms a people with peasant occupations and local markets into an industrial society with worldwide connections. This type of society makes great use of machinery and manufactures goods on a large scale for general consumption. The changes increased the demand for barrels, boxes, kegs, bags, and baskets to transport new consumer commodities and to bring great quantities of food into the cities. The fledging packaging industry itself had to mechanize. It became necessary to devise ways of preserving food beyond its natural biological life. In recent years there are notable advances in the packaging technology. Three basic functions of food packaging include storage, preservation and protection which are required today for better maintenance of quality and handling of foods. Advance packaging technologies which are becoming increasingly significant include intelligent packaging, active packaging, etc.
    <p>Tracing packaging to the early days of manufacturing in ancient times, humans used natural materials to package their goods according to Vihaan Nagal (2022), These materials included animal skins, woven cloth, and wooden crates. As civilization progressed, people began to use more durable materials to package their products. This led to the development of packaging technologies such as paper, cardboard, and plastic. Therefore, the evolution of packaging can also be traced back to the early days of manufacturing and today, the packaging is a vital part of our economy and has played a major role in the development of our society.</p>
